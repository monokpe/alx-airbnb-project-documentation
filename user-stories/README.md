# User Stories for the Airbnb Clone Project

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document outlines the core user stories that drive the development of the Airbnb Clone backend. User stories are a fundamental part of our Agile development process, serving several key purposes:

- **Translate Requirements into Action:** They break down high-level requirements and use case diagrams into small, user-centric units of work.
- **Maintain a User-Centric Focus:** By using the "As a..., I want to..., so that..." format, we ensure every feature is developed with a clear user goal and value proposition in mind.
- **Guide Development:** These stories form the basis of our product backlog. Each story will be a source for one or more development tasks, guiding sprints and releases.
- **Facilitate Communication:** They provide a shared, easy-to-understand language for developers, product managers, and designers, ensuring everyone is aligned on what needs to be built and why.

## 2. Source and Traceability

These user stories are not created in isolation. They are directly derived from the core functionalities outlined in the **[Project Requirements](/features-and-functionalities)** and the interactions visualized in the **[Use Case Diagram](/use-case-diagram/use-case-diagram.png)**. This ensures that our development work remains traceable to the original project objectives.
